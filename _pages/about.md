Hey, I'm Alice! I'm an indie game developer interested in `design`, `programming` and building `procedural systems` in Houdini.

After breaking into the games industry through Futuregames' Indie Game Developer class of '20, I've been deep-diving into building procedural tools both for level design and 3D generation.

Welcome to my space—where I share my projects and journey.
